# World-Population-Analysis-Report

## Introduction 
This project demonstrates a range of demographic and statistical information about the world's population which include:  Total Population: An overview of the current global population and its distribution across continents and countries. Population Growth Rates: Analysis of population growth rates, including birth rates, death rates &amp; migration. 

There are approximately 7.97 billion people living in the world today, a figure that shows a dramatic increase since the beginning of the Common Era. Since the 1970s, the global population has also more than doubled in size. It is estimated that the global population will reach and surpass eight billion people by 2025 and plateau at around 11 billion at the end of the century. The analysis gives you the opportunity to visualise all these at a glance and projcet what the population whould be in the coming years.

## Data Source

The data used for this project was gotten from Kaggle.com 


## Task

* Population Trends Over Time: How the population of each Continent / Country changed over the years (2022, 2020, 2015) specifically 3years was used?
* Top N Countries by Population: Top 5 countries with the highest population were Identified and visualized in 2022. Comparison of these Top N countries was visualised as the total population of each country was plotted against them.
* Geographical Analysis: Creating a world Map to aid our visualization and show the distribution of population percentage by country or continent.
* population density: Population density (people per km²) for each country was as well demonstrated and highlights of the continents with high and low population density was showcased.
* Continent-wise Analysis: The population comparison of each continent in 2015, 2020 and 2022 were as well depicted.? Which continent has the highest overall population density? This bothering question was answered in the visual as well.
* Visualisation Creating a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between a continent's area and its population density.


## Data Preparation and Transformation

In preparation of our dataset for the analysis, Power Bi was used to turn the unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. In response to the given task, a careful assessment of the necessary database tables was carried out. Specifically, the database table was imported as CSV format and tested for errors. The table which formed the basis for the subsequent steps was free of error during cleaning exercise.

Upon this, we are able to harmonise this dataset and turn the unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights
From this dataset, no measure was created as power Bi has made the automatic summation of the total population based on the years under consideration.

## Data Modelling

We only have a piece of dataset involved hence the logical representation of how data is structured and related within the tool and the collection of tables and relationships between them that are used to create reports and visualizations was not necessary since the integration of tables were not involved.


## Data Exploration and Visualization

As the data was structured, the summation of the total population has already been automatically done per year under consideration. Hence, these were used to create and present each population year against each continent to ensure the comparison among them are ready for visualisation. Year 2015, 2020 and 2022 were considered and inn all these Asia has the largest population in the world, while oceania has the lowest.

### Asia
When it comes to number of inhabitants per continent, Asia is the most populous continent in the world by a significant margin, with roughly 60 percent of the world's population living there. Similar to other global regions, a quarter of inhabitants in Asia are under 15 years of age. The most populous nations in the world were China and India respectively, both located on the Asian continent; each inhabit more than three times the amount of people than the third-ranked United States. 10 of the 20 most populous countries in the world are found in Asia. Not only is the total population in China increasing steadily, but the median age has also increased rapidly over the past six decades. Due to better health care and living conditions, it is estimated that the median age in China in 2020 was 37 years.



## Insights and Recommendations

It is only logical that an increase in the world’s population will cause additional strains on resources. More people means an increased demand for food, water, housing, energy, healthcare, transportation, and more. And all that consumption contributes to ecological degradation, increased conflicts, and a higher risk of large-scale disasters like pandemics.

Over a span of 2 years, our analysis shows that the percentage population increase of the world from 2020 to 2022 was 1.7%. Therefore, if this is not controlled, we could have the world overpopulated especially China and India. 

This can controlled using the combined efforts of spreading knowledge about family planning, increasing agency among women, and debunking widely held myths about contraception will measurably change the trajectory of the world’s population.



## Conclusion

Conclusively, my in-depth analysis of the data has brightens valuable insights into the world population as it relate to continent, country/region of the world. From analysing population growth rate and contributions of each continent to the population growth of the world,  I believe we have gained a comprehensive understanding of our the world population. These insights serve as a compass, guiding us towards population control by leveraging this fact presented as visuals and make informed decisions tha will make the life better for every inhabitant of tyhe world.
